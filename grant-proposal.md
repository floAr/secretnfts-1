## Development Roadmap
We will require 3 months to complete this project. We intend to hav 2 developers full-time and 1 part-time, at a total cost of $X,000.

Example milestones:
* Implement X (weeks 0 - 4).
* Implement Y (weeks 4 - 8).
* Implement Z (weeks 8 - 12).

Ideally, we can receive payments in 3 disbursements, one at the beginning of the grant, one after implementation of Y and last payment when the development work is completed.

We would be willing to consider part payment in SCRTs, up to x%.
